# COOPdao

First project of ConsenSys Academy's course, the developer bootcamp. 

Summary:
Kickstarter for co-ops. A protocol that acts similar to kickstarter, but is designed for workers, contractors, etc. to contribute funds towards the purchase of the business at which they are employed. 

Single Workflow:
An individual employee believes that the business owner would be willing to sell their business to the employees, and therefore goes to the coopDAO website, creates a profiles for the business, chooses whether or not the profile is public, and then a shareable link is available for them to send to all other employees. 

1. User creates an escrow contract through the web UI
2. User sets parameters for the escrow contract (i.e. kickstarter) that they will create for their campaign to purchase the business, or a share of the business. 
3. User creates an escrow contract through the web UI
4. User is then able to share the 'profile' to others using a unique, shareable link
5. Other users can contribute funds to the escrow contract
6. If a minimum is met, the contract will unlock the funds, allowing them to be sent to the seller of the business shares.
